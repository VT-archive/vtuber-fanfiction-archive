            <p>There is a separate, Google Drive based archive that has open edit permissions and features stories tagged by individual chuubas. If you would be so kind as to keep it up to date for even easier ease of use, please do so. Everyone can edit it, Anonymously.<br>
            <a target = '_blank' href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kgomS-ompLIyjD4ENL06RbXj1Yr6ICSVYwzvpFATKf8/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">Check it out.</a></p>

            <p>The original Pastebin archive can be found <a target = '_blank' href="https://pastebin.com/asvcqDLL" rel="nofollow noopener">here.</a></p>
            <p>Almost everything here is something cooked up for /vt/'s various 'post chuubas being abusive' threads, which expanded into the proper /wg/ - Writing General threads. Ranging from SFW to NSFW and everything vaguely in between. If you want something added or removed, please email me. If, perchance, you are an actual VTuber who has stumbled across this, be it by fate or some idiot spamming the link to you, please know that we are all very, very sorry, and all of this is made with nothing but love in mind. Please don't lynch us.</p>
            <p>A note for mobile users: Unfortunately due to issues with text scaling, this will probably be annoying to use. If you find that the text is to small i suggest you try the "reader view" function built into most mobile browsers. its not perfect but it helps</p>
